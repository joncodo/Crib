This is a grib simulator that I am making for a Hackathon that I am working on in Fredericton, NB.

The main goal of this project is to practice TDD and AI programming.

The crib engine will play out all the games from two player classes. The player classes contain the AI and will play the game to their best ability.

The final goal is to have people play their player classes against one another and see who wins.

How to run this???

Download the souce files and store them in a local directory.

Then run ruby crib.rb

You should see the output.

To run the tests:

rspec spec

Or you can test them one by one.
